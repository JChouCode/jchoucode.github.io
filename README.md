# Jeffrey Chou's Personal Website

Hello, nice to meet you.

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal website built from scratch. This is an updated version of my prior website, which was over 5 years old. <br>
I spent a lot of thought on the design and also the various animations incorporated when scrolling. <br>
